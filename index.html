                <p1>There were days where I would lay down and wonder “what now?” 
                Following my Master’s in Kinesiology with an emphasis 
                in Sport and Excercise Psychology, the job market seemed 
                bleak and hopeless. COVID-19 had taken a turn for the worst, 
                diminishing my hopes of finishing certification to become 
                a mental performance consultant. So you might ask, 
                “how did you end up here?” That question in itself, speaks 
                about my personality. A young individual who is comfortable 
                with the uncomfortable. An ambitious individual always 
                looking for ways to adapt, challenge oneself and learn. I 
                began my UX career due to unmitigated circumstances but 
                the choice to pursue this career remained true to how 
                I’ve always been: <b>someone wanting to provide quality 
                service to those in need.</b>
            <br>    
                I believe that effective product designing comes from the 
                stories our users tell. Stories about happiness, 
                frustrations, and wishful thoughts all fuel the designing 
                process I undertake with each design. By using various individuals'
                wishful thoughts and ideas, I am able to design products that provide
                quality user face interactions.

                As a young UX/UI professional, I continue
